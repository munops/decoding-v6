- [ ] independent blind fixture review

## Communication

- [x] capture a short non-sensitive [product demo GIF](./decoding-demo.gif)
- [x] prepare [Show HN post](./SHOW_HN.md) with local-only disclosure and technical architecture
- [x] prepare distinct [r/webdev, r/devops, and r/netsec drafts](./COMMUNITY_POSTS.md); posting remains pending current-rule and account checks
- [ ] connect Search Console and submit the generated sitemap
- [x] publish the [synthetic beta program](./BETA_PROGRAM.md) and [public recruitment issue](https://github.com/whoo3474/decoding-v6/issues/1); 10 real participants remain pending

## Privacy and support

- [x] public privacy page states storage and network boundaries
- [ ] DC-AUD-01 local terms/support/data inventory implemented; production route deployment and read-back pending
- [x] no account, payment, server decode, generative AI, product telemetry, or ad code
- [x] issue template forbids real tokens, credentials, private keys, and customer payloads
- [x] deployed synthetic secret appears in neither requests nor browser storage
- [x] enable GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting and publish the response schedule in `SECURITY.md`

Launch communication and monetization metrics remain evidence gates; deployment alone does not mark them complete.

2026-08-08 returning-profile audit found a stale service-worker shell referencing a removed CSS hash. DC-AUD-02 is implemented locally; the public launch remains blocked until the owner-lane release wave, provider read-back, fresh/returning-profile smoke, and linked-asset MIME verification pass.
