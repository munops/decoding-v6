# decod.ing v6

> Paste anything. See what it is — instantly, locally, safely.

decod.ing is a zero-account triage tool for unknown developer data. Paste a value without choosing a format first; it ranks plausible formats, keeps ambiguous candidates visible, follows recursive decode chains, and explains deterministic warnings on your device. A 47-operation local workbench is available after the first diagnosis.

Production: <https://decod.ing> · Source: <https://github.com/whoo3474/decoding-v6> · Staging: <https://decoding-v6-staging.wjstks3474.workers.dev>

## Product contract

- No login, account, subscription, checkout, paid feature, server-side decoding, or generative AI
- No raw-input history; the optional IndexedDB workspace stores only explicitly saved redacted structure
- No product telemetry or advertising code in the launch build
- Ads remain a disabled, code-free Phase 4 gate until real traffic, privacy, and performance thresholds pass
- Browser, PWA, CLI, desktop, and extension share the same local engine or operation runtimes

## Implemented surfaces

apps/desktop         Tauri 2 workbench, global shortcut, explicit clipboard, tray, windows
apps/extension       MV3 selection decoder with minimum permissions and no host access
apps/edge            reviewed empty boundary; no deployed Worker logic or bindings
packages/engine      eight-detector chain engine with limits and warnings
packages/operations  47 lazy local operation runtimes, Pack 1+2+3+4 = 16+11+10+10
